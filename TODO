less miserable shape constructor code.
	new geom.Bezier({
		start: P(1,0), sctl: P(2,3),
		end:   P(2,3), ectl: P(4,5)
	});
multi-part per pattern 
remove "make" from start of closure functions
say which part this is on every page: add part abbreviations
make margin lines extend completely across page

--- below = done ---

add part/pattern titles to preview page
add grid lines to preview
add joint indicators to lifesize poarts
BUG: preview is too tall (see testpattern with pagesize 5x5)
turn makexlateShape / makexlatePoint into methods on geom objects
bezier curve support
raise error when bbox is {} in yaml
